# Tengri OS
Tengri OS is an operating system written entirely in Rust, designed with a focus on development simplicity, modularity, and future extensibility.

Built around a CLI-first interface, Tengri OS lays the groundwork for a system that's minimal yet powerful. While currently command-line based, its architecture is consciously designed with graphical environments in mind, allowing for natural progression toward more interactive experiences in the future.

Rather than a standalone effort, Tengri OS represents the early foundation of a broader vision — one that explores the possibilities of a unified development experience under a single, cohesive system. It serves not only as a practical OS project but also as a stepping stone toward something more ambitious.

## Features
* Written 100% in safe and modern Rust

* Simple and modular kernel architecture

* CLI-based core system interface

* Graphics-aware system planning for future GUI support

* A pragmatic platform for system-level experimentation and prototyping

> Note: Tengri OS is more than just an operating system — it's a beginning. A quiet origin for something that may eventually evolve into a complete, high-level environment, yet deeply rooted in low-level philosophy.
